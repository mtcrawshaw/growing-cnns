This is a list of all of the variations of the proposed method.

- Growth speed (number of layers grows linearly or exponentially)
- Position of convolutional layer which doubles number of channels (before max pool or after
  max pool)
- Position of newly inserted layers for linear growth speed (beginning of section, any point
  in between, or end, whether to have them spaced out or clumped together)
- Growth method (Vanilla, skip, branching)
- Transition methods (Vanilla, freeze old layers, different learning rates, weighted average)
- Growth blocks (convolutional layer, resnet basic, resnet bottleneck, densenet, inception)
- Stopping for each growth step (fixed number of epochs, early stopping, convergence)
- Whether or not to copy batch norm parameters from previous layer

Training techniques:
- All the normal ones (batch norm, dropout, optimizer + optimizer params, etc)
- New regularization techniques (dropfilter, dropblock, droppath, stochastic depth)
-
