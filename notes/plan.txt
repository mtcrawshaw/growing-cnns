Functionality cards:
expandNode, rename expandEdge (include numConvAdded parameter)
Different growth speeds (expand all, expand youngest, expand oldest)
Join modes and weighting modes
Random initialization of new layers under certain weighting modes
Copy batch norm parameters from previous layer
Loss convergence (rename current lossConvergence to earlyStopping)

Errand cards:
Add ImageNet + other datasets
Parallelize across multiple GPUs
Add different block types
Dynamic batch sizes across growth steps using model size estimation (https://github.com/jacobkimmel/pytorch_modelsize)
Fix argument structure for training/evaluation
Convert to package and fix imports
Add option for CPU only
Clean/break up main
Clean/break up testGrowthController.py
Add test names to ./runTests output
Create plots from logs
Automatically create cifar-small if it doesn't exist
